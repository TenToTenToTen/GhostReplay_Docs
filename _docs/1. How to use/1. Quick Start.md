This guide will walk you through the process of setting up the Bloodstain Replay system on a basic Character using Blueprints.

> **Prerequisite:** This guide is based on the standard **Third-Person Template** in Unreal Engine 5.

---

### 1. Open Your Player Character Blueprint

First, open your primary player character Blueprint. For this guide, we will use **`BP_ThirdPersonCharacter`**.

### 2. Get the Bloodstain Subsystem

In the Event Graph, get a reference to the **`Bloodstain Subsystem`**. This subsystem is the main entry point for all recording and playback functionality.

### 3. Wire Up the Core Functions

For this basic setup, we'll trigger the core functions using keyboard inputs. Connect the **`Start Recording`**, **`Stop Recording`**, and **`Spawn All Blood Stains in Level`** nodes to key press events.

<div class="notice--info">
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> In a real project, you would trigger these from game events, such as <strong><code>Event OnDied</code></strong> for stopping a recording, or <strong><code>Event OnPlayerSpawned</code></strong> for spawning existing stains.
</div>

The default settings record the last 5 seconds at 10 FPS. These can be configured in the **`Options`** struct.

### 4. Create an Interaction Variable

To handle interaction, we need a variable to store a reference to the bloodstain actor we are currently overlapping. Create a new variable named `InteractableStain` of type **`BP_BloodStainActor` (Object Reference)**.

### 5. Detect Overlaps with Bloodstains

Use the **`Event ActorBeginOverlap`** and **`Event ActorEndOverlap`** events to manage the `InteractableStain` variable.

-   When the player overlaps with a **`BP_BloodStainActor`**, set the `InteractableStain` variable.
-   When the player stops overlapping, clear the variable by setting it to **`null`**.

### 6. Set Up the Interact Logic

Create an input event (e.g., 'F' key). When pressed, check if the `InteractableStain` variable is valid. If it is, call the **`Interact`** function on it to trigger the replay.

### 7. Test the Interaction

After recording and spawning the bloodstains, walk into the trigger volume of a spawned stain. An interaction prompt should appear.

### 8. Trigger the Replay

Press the interact key ('F'). The replay of the recorded actor's final moments will now play.

### (Optional) Applying a Custom Ghost Material

To apply a custom "ghost" effect to replayed actors, you can set a default material in the subsystem.

1.  The plugin provides a sample material named **`M_DefaultGhostMaterial`** in its content folder.
2.  Call the **`Set Default Material`** function on the **`Bloodstain Subsystem`** to apply it globally.

<div class="notice--success">
<strong>Best Practice:</strong> A good place to call this function is in your <strong><code>GameMode</code></strong>'s <strong><code>Event BeginPlay</code></strong>, as it only needs to be set once when the game starts.
</div>
