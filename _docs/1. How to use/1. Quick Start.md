This guide will walk you through the process of setting up the Bloodstain Replay system on a basic Character using Blueprints.

> **Prerequisite:** This guide is based on the standard **Third-Person Template** in Unreal Engine 5.

---

### 1. Open Your Player Character Blueprint

First, open your primary player character Blueprint. For this guide, we will use **`BP_ThirdPersonCharacter`**.

### 2. Get the Bloodstain Subsystem

In the Event Graph, get a reference to the **`Bloodstain Subsystem`**. This subsystem is the main entry point for all recording and playback functionality.

### 3. Wire Up the Core Functions

For this basic setup, we'll trigger the core functions using keyboard inputs. Connect the **`Start Recording`**, **`Stop Recording`**, and **`Spawn All Blood Stains in Level`** nodes to key press events.

<div class="notice--info">
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> In a real project, you would trigger these from game events, such as <strong><code>Event OnDied</code></strong> for stopping a recording, or <strong><code>Event OnPlayerSpawned</code></strong> for spawning existing stains.
</div>

The default settings record the last 5 seconds at 10 FPS. These can be configured in the **`Options`** struct.

### 4. Create an Interaction Variable

To handle interaction, we need a variable to store a reference to the bloodstain actor we are currently overlapping. Create a new variable named `InteractableStain` of type **`BP_BloodStainActor` (Object Reference)**.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/QuickStart (4).png" alt="Create InteractableStain variable" />

### 5. Detect Overlaps with Bloodstains

Use the **`Event ActorBeginOverlap`** and **`Event ActorEndOverlap`** events to manage the `InteractableStain` variable.

-   When the player overlaps with a **`BP_BloodStainActor`**, set the `InteractableStain` variable.
-   When the player stops overlapping, clear the variable by setting it to **`null`**.

### 6. Set Up the Interact Logic

Create an input event (e.g., 'F' key). When pressed, check if the `InteractableStain` variable is valid. If it is, call the **`Interact`** function on it to trigger the replay.

### 7. Test the Interaction

After recording and spawning the bloodstains, walk into the trigger volume of a spawned stain. An interaction prompt should appear.

### 8. Trigger the Replay

Press the interact key ('F'). The replay of the recorded actor's final moments will now play.

### Configuring Options

You can customize the recording, playback, and file-saving behavior by adjusting several key options.

#### 1. Recording Options

When calling **`Start Recording`**, you can provide a `FBloodStainRecordOptions` struct to control how the data is captured.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/QuickStart (11).png" alt="Recording Options Struct" width="500"/>

*   **`Time To Record`**: The maximum duration (in seconds) to record. For example, a value of 5.0 will only save the last 5 seconds of activity.
*   **`Sampling Interval`**: The time in seconds between each recorded frame. A smaller value (e.g., 0.033 for ~30 FPS) results in smoother replays but larger file sizes.
*   **`bDetectAttachments` / `bDetectDetachments`**: If enabled, the system will record when components are attached or detached from the actor, allowing for dynamic changes like equipping or unequipping weapons.
*   **`bSaveImmediatelyOnGroupEmpty`**: If true, the recording will be saved to a file as soon as the last actor in the recording group is destroyed or stops recording.

#### 2. Playback Options

After spawning a `BloodStainActor`, you can customize its playback behavior. These options are typically set on the `PlayComponent` when you initialize the replay.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/QuickStart (12).png" alt="Playback Options" width="500"/>

*   **`Playback Rate`**: Controls the speed of the replay. `1.0` is normal speed, `2.0` is double speed, and `-1.0` plays the replay in reverse.
*   **`bIsLooping`**: If true, the replay will loop continuously until stopped.
*   **`bUseGhostMaterial`**: If true, the replayed actor will use the default "ghost" material instead of its original materials.

<div class="notice--info">
<strong>Applying the Ghost Material:</strong> To use the <strong><code>bUseGhostMaterial</code></strong> option, you must first set a default material in the subsystem. The plugin includes a sample material at <strong><code>M_DefaultGhostMaterial</code></strong>. Call the <strong><code>Set Default Material</code></strong> function from your GameMode to apply it globally.
</div>

When the ghost material is applied, the replay will look like this:

#### 3. File Save Options

You can configure the file compression and data quantization settings globally from the `Bloodstain Subsystem`. This allows you to balance file size against data precision.

*   **Compression Method**: Determines the algorithm used to compress the final save file.
    *   `None`: No compression. Fastest, but largest file size.
    *   `Zlib`, `Gzip`, `LZ4`: Industry-standard compression algorithms. `LZ4` is generally very fast, while `Gzip` often provides higher compression ratios.
*   **Quantization Level**: Reduces the precision of floating-point data (like location and rotation) to significantly reduce file size.
    *   `None`: Full precision, largest data size.
    *   `Standard High`: High precision, good balance of quality and size.
    *   `Standard Compact` / `Standard Low`: Lower precision, resulting in much smaller files at the cost of some accuracy. Ideal for less critical replays or network replication.
