### Configuring Options

You can customize the recording, playback, and file-saving behavior by adjusting several key options.

#### 1. Recording Options

When calling **`Start Recording`**, you can provide a `FBloodStainRecordOptions` struct to control how the data is captured.

*   **`Time To Record`**: The maximum duration (in seconds) to record. For example, a value of 5.0 will only save the last 5 seconds of activity.
*   **`Sampling Interval`**: The time in seconds between each recorded frame. A smaller value (e.g., 0.033 for ~30 FPS) results in smoother replays but larger file sizes.
*   **`bDetectAttachments` / `bDetectDetachments`**: If enabled, the system will record when components are attached or detached from the actor, allowing for dynamic changes like equipping or unequipping weapons.
*   **`bSaveImmediatelyOnGroupEmpty`**: If true, the recording will be saved to a file as soon as the last actor in the recording group is destroyed or stops recording.

#### 2. Playback Options

After spawning a `BloodStainActor`, you can customize its playback behavior. These options are typically set on the `PlayComponent` when you initialize the replay.

*   **`Playback Rate`**: Controls the speed of the replay. `1.0` is normal speed, `2.0` is double speed, and `-1.0` plays the replay in reverse.
*   **`bIsLooping`**: If true, the replay will loop continuously until stopped.
*   **`bUseGhostMaterial`**: If true, the replayed actor will use the default "ghost" material instead of its original materials.

<strong>Applying the Ghost Material:</strong> To use the <strong><code>bUseGhostMaterial</code></strong> option, you must first set a default material in the subsystem. The plugin includes a sample material at <strong><code>M_DefaultGhostMaterial</code></strong>. Call the <strong><code>Set Default Material</code></strong> function from your GameMode to apply it globally.

When the ghost material is applied, the replay will look like this:

#### 3. File Save Options

You can configure the file compression and data quantization settings globally from the `Bloodstain Subsystem`. This allows you to balance file size against data precision.

*   **Compression Method**: Determines the algorithm used to compress the final save file.
    *   `None`: No compression. Fastest, but largest file size.
    *   `Zlib`, `Gzip`, `LZ4`: Industry-standard compression algorithms. `LZ4` is generally very fast, while `Gzip` often provides higher compression ratios.
*   **Quantization Level**: Reduces the precision of floating-point data (like location and rotation) to significantly reduce file size.
    *   `None`: Full precision, largest data size.
    *   `Standard High`: High precision, good balance of quality and size.
    *   `Standard Compact` / `Standard Low`: Lower precision, resulting in much smaller files at the cost of some accuracy. Ideal for less critical replays or network replication.
