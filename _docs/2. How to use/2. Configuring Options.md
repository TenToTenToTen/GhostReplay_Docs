### Configuring Options

You can customize the recording, playback, and file-saving behavior by adjusting several key options.

---

#### 1. Recording Options

When calling **`Start Recording`**, you can provide a `FBloodStainRecordOptions` struct to control how the data is captured.

*   **`Recording Group Name`**: The name of the group to record. If left as `None`, it defaults to "BloodStainReplay".
*   **`File Name`**: The name of the file to save. If not specified, a name will be generated based on a timestamp.
*   **`Tags`**: Assigns gameplay tags to the recording. This allows you to categorize and later filter replays, for example, by `BossFight` or `PlayerDeath`.
*   **`Sampling Interval`**: The time in seconds between each recorded frame. A smaller value (e.g., 0.033 for ~30 FPS) results in smoother replays but larger file sizes.
*   **`Track Attachment Changes`**: If enabled, the system will record when components are attached or detached from the actor, allowing for dynamic changes like equipping or unequipping weapons.
*   **`Save Immediately If Group Empty`**: If true, the recording will be saved to a file as soon as the last actor in the recording group is destroyed or stops recording.

#### 2. Playback Options

When spawning a bloodstain, you can provide a `FBloodStainPlaybackOptions` struct to customize its playback behavior.

*   **`Playback Rate`**: Controls the speed of the replay. `1.0` is normal speed, `2.0` is double speed, and `-1.0` plays the replay in reverse.
*   **`IsLooping`**: If true, the replay will loop continuously until stopped.
*   **`Use Ghost Material`**: If true, the replayed actor will use the specified ghost material instead of its original materials.
*   **`Group Ghost Material`**: A `UMaterialInterface` that overrides the actor's materials during replay, allowing you to apply a custom visual effect.

> **Applying the Ghost Material:** To use the **`Use Ghost Material`** option, you must provide a material to the **`Group Ghost Material`** input. The plugin includes a sample material named **`DefaultGhostMaterial`**. You can find it by enabling "Show Plugin Content" in the Content Browser's filter settings.

When the ghost material is applied, the replay will look like this:

#### 3. File Save Options

You can configure the file compression and data quantization settings globally from the `Bloodstain Subsystem`. This allows you to balance file size against data precision. These settings are typically configured once, for example, in your `GameMode`'s `BeginPlay` event.

*   **`Compression Method`**: Determines the algorithm used to compress the final save file.
    *   `None`: No compression. Fastest, but largest file size.
    *   `Zlib`, `Gzip`, `LZ4`: Industry-standard compression algorithms. `LZ4` is generally very fast, while `Gzip` often provides higher compression ratios.
*   **`Quantization Level`**: Reduces the precision of floating-point data (like location and rotation) to significantly reduce file size.
    *   `None`: Full precision, largest data size.
    *   `Standard High`: High precision, offering a good balance between quality and size.
    *   `Standard Medium` / `Standard Low`: Lower precision, resulting in much smaller files at the cost of some accuracy. Ideal for less critical replays or network replication.
