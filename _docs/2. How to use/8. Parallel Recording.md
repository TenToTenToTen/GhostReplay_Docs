## OverView

This page explains parallel recording on a per-group basis.

This tutorial assumes you have completed the Quick Start.


### About Group

A Group is a collection of Actors associated with a single recording session. All recording start/stop operations and playback are performed on a per-Group basis. Each Group corresponds one-to-one with a File.

### Parallel Recording

You can start separate recordings by using different Group Names.
If you use the default value for `RecordOption` or set the Group Name to `Name_None`, the default Group Name will be used.

**Note** â€“ There is currently no exception handling for recording a single Actor in multiple Groups simultaneously, which may lead to unexpected errors.

This is a known issue and we are actively working to resolve it.
