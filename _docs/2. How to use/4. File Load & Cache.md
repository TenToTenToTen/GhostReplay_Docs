## OverView

This page explains how to load files into cache and manage them.
To understand the file format, please refer to the `About File` page.

This tutorial assumes you have completed the Quick Start.


## Tutorial

The file header and body are loaded and cached separately.

Using the header data, you can filter and then load only the full files you need.
For more details, refer to the `Filtering File` page.


### File Directory 방식

When saving a file, it is stored as `{LevelName}/{FileName}.bin`.

If the FileName contains `/` or `\`, they will be replaced with spaces.

**Notes** – We are considering adding support for setting a custom subdirectory.


### File Load & Cache

The file header and body can be loaded and cached using the example APIs below.
Loaded data is automatically cached and will persist unless you call `Load All Headers` or `Clear`.

For detailed API information, please refer to the `UBloodStainSubSystem` page.
