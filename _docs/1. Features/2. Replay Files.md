## File Format

From a file data perspective, it consists of metadata called the Header and frame data called the Replay Data.

The Header Data is divided into a basic metadata section (Header) and a runtime struct section (UserData). The UserData stores both the `UStaticStruct` and the actual memory values using an `FInstancedStruct`.

The Replay Data contains information for each Actor, and this information includes Frame Data, Attach/Detach Data, and more.


## Quantization & Compression

Supports quantization and compression (for Zlib, LZ4, GZip).
